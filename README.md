This project implements Linear Regression from scratch using Gradient Descent to predict housing prices based on house size.


âœ… Standard Algorithms:

Hypothesis Function: prediction(x, w, b) computes the linear model output.
Cost Function: cost(x, y, w, b) calculates Mean Squared Error.
Gradient Descent: gradientdescent(x, y, w, b, learning_rate, epochs) optimizes model parameters (w, b).


ðŸ“Š Visualizations:

Cost vs. Iterations: Tracks how the cost decreases over training epochs.
Regression Line: Plots the best-fit line against training data.


ðŸ’¡ Interactive Prediction:

Users can input a house size to get a predicted price.
Warns if input is outside the training data range.
