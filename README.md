This project implements Linear Regression from scratch using Gradient Descent to predict housing prices based on house size.


âœ… Standard Algorithms:

Hypothesis Function: prediction(x, w, b) computes the linear model output.

Cost Function: cost(x, y, w, b) calculates Mean Squared Error.

Gradient Descent: gradientdescent(x, y, w, b, learningrate, iterations) optimizes model parameters w and b.


ðŸ“Š Visualizations:

Cost vs. Iterations: Tracks how the cost decreases over training iterations.

Regression Line: Plots the best fit line against training data.


ðŸ’¡ Interactive Prediction:

Users can input a house size to get a predicted price.

Warns if input is outside the training data range.
